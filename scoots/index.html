    - A call to action to make a rental reservation.

    - Readily available navigation and contact information.

    - Summary information about all the types of rentals.

    - Social media links (a general link is OK)

    - Weather information from the free version of openweathermap.org. Here is the minimum information to include on the page:
        ✔️ The current temperature        
        ✔️ The current humidity
        ✔️ The next day's forecasted temperature at 15:00 (3:00pm).
        ✔️ All the weather data points provided including the main (which is the title, e.g., "Clouds"), the description, and the associated weather icon.

    - There may likely only be one data point under weather but your code should display any and all if provided by the API.

    - Include a closeable message at the very top of the page that provides the high temperature temp-max for the current day.
